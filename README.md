# Leaflet-Challenge

Level 1 - Basic Visualization
https://amelchristy.github.io/Leaflet/Leaflet-Step-1/

  1. Get data from USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize.
  2. Import and visualize the data by creating a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

Level 2 - More data

The USGS wants to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. I pull in a second data set and visualize it along side the original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
